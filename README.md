## GitHub Bio: IFSP - Campus Birigui Student | Programming Enthusiast

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, fellow GitHub users! Welcome to my profile! 

ðŸŽ“ I am a second-year student at the Federal Institute of SÃ£o Paulo (IFSP), specifically at the Birigui campus. My main focus of study and exploration lies in the vast world of programming.

ðŸ’» I am currently engaged in honing my programming skills and expanding my knowledge in various programming languages, including but not limited to Python, Java, and C++. As I progress through my academic journey, I am continuously exploring different fields within computer science to discover my true passion.

ðŸ“š In addition to my formal education, I also dedicate myself to self-learning through online resources, coding challenges, and personal projects. I believe that hands-on experience and practical implementation are essential for solidifying theoretical concepts.

ðŸŒ± As an aspiring developer, I am fascinated by the ever-evolving nature of technology and the boundless possibilities it offers. I am particularly interested in web development. I am eager to leverage my skills to contribute to exciting projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via email or social media platforms. I would be delighted to connect with fellow programmers, developers, and tech enthusiasts!
